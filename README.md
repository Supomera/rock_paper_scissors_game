Rock Paper Scissors game player vs computer


As the game progress and more inputs are gathered from the user, the computer tries to counter the user by considering the frequency of player's actions. For example, if user has mostly selected the rock so far, computer should select paper (which counters the rock) with a higher probability compared to other options.
